# Image Mosaicing
This project presents our implementation of an image mosaicing model by estimating a homography between corresponding corner features extracted by Harris corner detector. Concretely, given a pair of color images with partial overlap, we fitstly convert them into gray-scale and apply Harris algorithm to get a sparse set of corner features. Then normalized cross correlation (NCC) of image patches centered at each corner is computed on the two set of corners. We choose potential correspondences by finding pair of corners such that they have the highest NCC value. From the noisy correspondences, RANSAC is used to robustly estimate the homography. Finally, one image is warped onto the other one accordingly to get a mosaic containing the union of all pixels from both input images.
